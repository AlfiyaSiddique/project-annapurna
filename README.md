# Food Donation Application ü§ù

## Overview üåü

This is a food donation application that connects NGOs and restaurants. The purpose of this platform is to enable restaurants to donate surplus food to people in need through partnering NGOs. The application includes features such as Google geocoding for location services üåç, email OTP notifications ‚úâÔ∏è for secure authentication, and a contact us page üìû for users to reach out with any inquiries or concerns.

Features üöÄ

- **Restaurant Donation:** Restaurants can donate surplus food to NGOs through the platform.
- **NGO Partnership:** NGOs can receive food donations from restaurants and distribute them to people in need
- **Google Geocoding:** Integration with Google Geocoding API for accurate location services.
- **Email OTP Notifications:** Users receive One-Time Password (OTP) notifications via email for secure authentication. 
- **Contact Us Page:** Users can contact the support team or administration through the contact us page.
- **Authentication:** Implement authentication functionality to ensure secure access to the application's features and user data. This can include user registration, login, and session management, using techniques such as username/password or social media authentication. Authentication adds an extra layer of security and allows personalized user experiences within the platform.

Step 8: Create a PR on Github. (Don't just hit the create a pull request button, you must write a PR message to clarify why and what are you contributing)


## Configuring the .env file 

The following environment variable are necessary for configuring the project on your local - 

- **Azure** 

You must have an azure storage account for the project. Images are stored as a **blob** in azure. So we need to have a blob container which we would access through our **access keys**

If you are a student then you can sign up for a $100 free credit on azure [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/free/students/)

![azure_sa_img](https://github.com/subhashis2204/project-annapurna/assets/76895635/1bd490ac-cf36-42df-ae52-091ff8e6bcc3)

After selecting the storage account. We need to create a new resource.

![azure_sa_create](https://github.com/subhashis2204/project-annapurna/assets/76895635/8b68b18f-b0eb-4fc4-8aed-60e092920ae9)

A form is displayed. You only need to fill the type of subscription and the name of storage account. Leave rest to default.

Then go to the resource and search for access keys.

![azure_sa_aks](https://github.com/subhashis2204/project-annapurna/assets/76895635/95f17ab5-c14f-4e63-b3ea-3cdfd4be5989)

There you will find **storage account name** and **connection string** (there are 2 of them, choose any one) 

As a final step in the resource page you have to setup the container where we would store the images.

In your newly created storage acc dashboard, click on the blob storage

![azure_sa_dashbrd](https://github.com/subhashis2204/project-annapurna/assets/76895635/769dbe7e-9718-4ea5-aac0-5829528642db)

You must see a page where you can create a new container. **Remember this name as we need it**

The env variable are - 

`CONTAINER_NAME = <your container name goes here>` <br/>
`CONNECTION_STRING = <your connection string goes here>`

- **Sendgrid email notification**

Sendgrid is a bulk emailing service. This project uses Sendgrid along with nodemailer to send transactional emails.

To get started you must have a sendgrid account. You can create one [here](https://sendgrid.com/). You can opt for the free tier. It does not require any credit card.

After signup you need to create an API key. **copy the api key and save it somewhere since you won't be able to see it again**.

Since, we have reached this far. One final step is that we have to setup an email which would be authorized to send emails using sendgrid. 
Go to the dashboard and on the left pane go to **settings** --> **sender authentication** --> **single sender verification** --> click on **create new sender**

![sendgrid_auth2](https://github.com/subhashis2204/project-annapurna/assets/76895635/b8a52663-6c70-4ec6-b73a-a3eb62c52409)

Fill in the necessary details and then you can start sending email using sendgrid. 

`CONTACTS_EMAIL_NAME = <name of the person who would be receiving the contact us messages>` <br>
`CONTACTS_EMAIL = <email where you would receive the messages from contact us page>` <br>
`SENDER_MAIL = <your sendgrid verified email>` <br>
`SENDGRID_API_KEY = <your API key goes here>`

- **Mongodb**
For running our application we need a DB. This project uses mongodb as the database. You can create a free account on the mongodb website and create a db in the cloud.

First you have to create a **project**, then after creating a project you can create a DB.

Go to the dashboard and on the **left pane** search **deployments**, then click **Build a database**

![db_deploy](https://github.com/subhashis2204/project-annapurna/assets/76895635/9f4386b6-4f03-4dfd-8721-d728e00f7252)

You would be redirected to a page where you have to choose the config of database. Choose **free tier** and choose a cloud provider and **any region of your choice** and **choose a cluster name**

You would be provided a **username** and **password**. Note them down somewhere.

Scroll down to the IP access list. Add **0.0.0.0** as the ip. This would enable global access to your db. Click on **close**
![ip_access](https://github.com/subhashis2204/project-annapurna/assets/76895635/86e4a223-170f-4d32-ab7b-6551104a9a30)

A typical mongodb url string looks like this : mongodb+srv://\<username\>:\<password\>@cluster345.hy4gkmn.mongodb.net/

The **username** is already given. You need to replace the **password** in the connection string. This gives the full connection string.

`MONGODB_URL = <mongodb connection string>`

- **Google Maps API (OPTIONAL)**

To show the google maps in the profile pages of restaurants and NGO we need to sign up for a google map API. This project specifically uses **GOOGLE maps Javascript API**.

`GOOGLEMAP_TOKEN = <YOUR API KEY GOES HERE>`

## Tech Stacks üíª

- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database used for storing and retrieving data.
- **Express:** Web application framework for building server-side applications.
- **Node.js:** Runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript):** A templating engine that generates HTML markup with JavaScript.
- **JavaScript:** Programming language used for the application's logic and functionality.
- **HTML:** Markup language for creating the structure and content of web pages.
- **CSS:** Styling language for visually enhancing the user interface.

## Setup and Deployment ‚öôÔ∏è

To set up and deploy the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure environment variables for APIs and services.
4. Start the application: `nodemon index.js`
7.  Access the application in a web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
